trait TimeStewardModificationReverter {
  fn revert (event: ?????)->invalidated stuff etc., like the return value of the original modify functions;

trait TimeStewardDataThingy {
  // query functions, which take an accessor and possibly a prediction handle, which may be stored in self for future invalidation
  // modify functions, which take a mutator and
  // - possibly return invalidated prediction handles
  // â€“ possibly return spawned predictions, as from creating a new entity
  // - assuming this is for a full TimeSteward, return a StewardRc <TimeStewardModificationReverter> (which, for the simple case, may be a Self). This makes each potential reversion take at least a fat-pointer to store, unless we can make StewardRc be a thin pointer with the vtable at the destination.
